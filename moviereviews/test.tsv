907	Somehow Ms. Griffiths and Mr. Pryce bring off this wild Welsh whimsy .

249	It 's more enjoyable than I expected , though , and that 's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs .
1679	Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .
1275	There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .

6431	Mel Gibson fights the good fight in Vietnam in director Randall Wallace 's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency .
669	So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
7402	I believe Silberling had the best intentions here , but he just does n't have the restraint to fully realize them .
7227	A Movie to Forget
8173	Singer\/composer Bryan Adams contributes a slew of songs -- a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story -- but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece .
2629	-LRB- Davis -RRB- wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .
176	Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
3425	Gloriously straight from the vagina .
8344	A chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness .
8241	-LRB- Allen -RRB- manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise .
708	Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .
7994	Quelle surprise !
2684	Promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish .
141	Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
3047	Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .
1146	One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
5939	Since the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .
4638	You 'll cry for your money back .
1481	There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .
4037	The movie worked for me right up to the final scene , and then it caved in .
4821	This new Time Machine is hardly perfect ... yet it proves surprisingly serviceable .
2771	Y
8540	... either you 're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you 're not .
2393	Tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .
6031	Below is well below expectations .
189	The result might look like Vulgar .
6926	Made-Up lampoons the moviemaking process itself , while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on America 's skin-deep notions of pulchritude .
381	Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible .
3648	It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .
6984	Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
6377	It 's a tour de force , written and directed so quietly that it 's implosion rather than explosion you fear .
2058	Full of surprises .
1964	As literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children 's entertainment .
6167	A confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design .
6474	No , I hate it .
1893	If you 're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you 're in luck .
2832	Dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch .
3615	Unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of ... emotional recovery .
1453	Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .
8427	More mature than Fatal Attraction , more complete than Indecent Proposal and more relevant than 9 1\/2 Weeks , Unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema .
1398	And , thanks to the presence of ` the King , ' it also rocks .
6981	Will you go ape over this movie ?
4836	Demonstrates a vivid imagination and an impressive style that result in some terrific setpieces .
2151	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .
1114	Not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time .
8528	It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film .
6281	Thumbs down .
660	Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .
1499	Yes , soar .
7436	A lame comedy .
2693	The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .
1661	But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .
5761	According to Wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .
6293	Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment .
851	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
7996	The biggest problem with this movie is that it 's not nearly long enough .
2799	Shunji Iwai 's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan .
548	After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
7614	Not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet .
2210	It 's never dull and always looks good .
4970	Films are made of little moments .
2018	Although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , Dogtown and Z-Boys has a compelling story to tell .
988	Viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for Holm 's performance , the film would be a total washout .
5205	Sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now ... and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors .
4000	This is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem .
5310	What it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread .
6443	Completely awful Iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .
4558	Please , someone , stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film .
5053	Like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone .
7301	... too sappy for its own good .
5120	An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .
3875	Return to Never Land is reliable , standard Disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages .
4608	While centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the Yiddish theater , both in America and Israel .
5087	... a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing .
7371	A movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart .
5771	Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist Japanese jokes .
3161	How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
5144	An old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher 's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue .
3274	It 's one long bore .
5422	This documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what -LRB- Evans -RRB- had , lost , and got back .
3257	But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
7761	Laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , No Such Thing is a fascinating little tale .
5218	A highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world .
1326	Nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining .
4489	Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .
5389	You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
234	Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
3500	It 's a testament to De Niro and director Michael Caton-Jones that by movie 's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all .
5377	A movie just for Friday fans , critics be damned .
7328	There 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening .
8419	Cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .
1418	And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .
1783	Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
7441	Most consumers of lo mein and General Tso 's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons .
4838	The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
7785	Lan Yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece .
5286	De Niro cries .
3502	Those who are n't put off by the film 's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them .
3734	Mama Africa pretty much delivers on that promise .
4717	Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
4067	It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
2837	Formulaic to the 51st power , more like .
4127	Robert John Burke as The Monster horns in and steals the show .
4934	but rather , ` How can you charge money for this ? '
1603	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
3087	Elegant , mannered and teasing .
4401	out ballsy and stylish
3548	Ian Holm conquers France as an earthy Napoleon
6581	But as you watch the movie , you 're too interested to care .
5845	Like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it 's one tough rock .
388	Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .
4436	The action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the Star Wars series .
3155	And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .
6462	The story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic .
4292	They just do n't work in concert .
6626	The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
2661	Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen .
4128	The result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today 's Hollywood .
4334	It establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout .
119	The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , B movie way , they succeed .
2888	Though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film does n't ignore the more problematic aspects of Brown 's life .
5005	Streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , `` Big Trouble '' is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter .
4385	If swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .
1884	A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .
3053	It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .
7800	It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
6606	It 's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon .
1375	Does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of Richard Nixon .
2345	You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
177	This is a children 's film in the truest sense .
6170	Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
5273	Marinated
2826	The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
7232	The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
8022	There is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all .
6459	It looks good , but it is essentially empty .
7956	Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
7488	under-rehearsed and lifeless
5504	Michael Moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he 's got as potent a topic as ever here .
4446	Not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially San Francisco lovers -- it 's a spirited film and a must-see .
2315	Pretty good little movie .
2442	Indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions .
158	Eerily accurate depiction of depression .
8191	May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .
3254	A stylish thriller .
3528	Caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose .
6216	They are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre .
2707	My Wife is an Actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy .
5475	A fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to Betty Fisher and left out the other stories .
5506	The difference between Cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited .
3886	A selection of scenes in search of a movie .
3851	Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .
474	An emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema .
2937	Begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish .
1852	Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
2787	What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
330	` Hey Arnold ! '
5126	A Jewish WW II doc that is n't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience !
245	Robert Harmon 's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in - the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film 's thick shadows .
4557	Does n't add up to much .
7588	There 's so much to look at in Metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles .
5033	There are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .
3559	There 's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and The Count of Monte Cristo ... never quite settles on either side .
7853	The power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing did n't get our moral hackles up .
5779	Ignoring that , he made Swimfan anyway
2062	About Amy 's cuteness , Amy 's career success -LRB- she 's a best-selling writer of self-help books who ca n't help herself -RRB- , and Amy 's neuroses when it comes to men .
4076	The bottom line is the piece works brilliantly .
5412	It 's always fascinating to watch Marker the essayist at work .
3356	The work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims .
8278	Arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation .
3813	Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .
6883	It 's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought .
1260	... a light , yet engrossing piece .
7972	If Reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show is n't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time .
1039	The modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
6983	It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .
1717	I like it .
2436	There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
6262	That 's not vintage Spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .
7964	It 's as if Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself .
1523	The Pianist -LRB- is -RRB- a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war 's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life .
6278	An entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie .
6623	It 's worth taking the kids to .
7595	Katz 's documentary does n't have much panache , but with material this rich it does n't need it .
4885	A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .
4786	We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .
2639	Nothing too deep or substantial .
3990	Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
8217	Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .
7936	Medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt .
4083	Both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter .
4696	Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .
1291	In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
1494	World Traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it 's certainly an honest attempt to get at something .
3756	Silly , loud and goofy .
4471	The work of a filmmaker who has secrets buried at the heart of his story and knows how to take time revealing them .
1121	There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
4082	The film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant .
6429	Making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though Chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love 's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror .
2157	... Jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts .
2144	With the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like Tremors , Eight Legged Freaks is prime escapist fare .
6943	... Tara Reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant , so I do n't know what she 's doing in here ...
2698	Wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too .
2611	If the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well .
4584	It 's better than mid-range Steven Seagal , but not as sharp as Jet Li on rollerblades .
1560	So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
6761	One feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early Italian neorealism .
3815	Definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .
3499	If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .
7667	Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .
732	If you 've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart .
6370	While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
3325	Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
8059	The only time 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers .
2352	It 's funny .
5305	Brings together some of the biggest names in Japanese anime , with impressive results .
4753	Sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this Argentinean ` dramedy ' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors .
6041	Too often , Son of the Bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained `` big moment '' will occur and not `` if . ''
2818	There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .
3572	What we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .
7226	The director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .
3935	The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works .
1522	While Insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , Nolan 's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends -LRB- it -RRB- stimulating depth .
2824	, with cheapo animation -LRB- like Saturday morning TV in the '60s -RRB- , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names .
7362	Your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but .
373	Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .
4383	What makes this film special is Serry 's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context .
8200	About as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come .
8301	Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
792	With `` Ichi the Killer '' , Takashi Miike , Japan 's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than Batman ...
3050	Like an Afterschool Special with costumes by Gianni Versace , Mad Love looks better than it feels .
2899	overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
6903	I have a confession to make : I did n't particularly like E.T. the first time I saw it as a young boy .
4528	Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
7715	The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .
3764	And educational !
687	Director Claude Chabrol has become the master of innuendo .
150	It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
2468	Sometimes shorter is better .
4451	Although Frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work .
1829	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
6330	are both superb , while Huppert ... is magnificent .
5085	... an enjoyably frothy ` date movie ' ...
4706	An overwrought Taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .
1813	Like Shrek , Spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .
6428	It 's Quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer .
5128	Austin Powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later .
1466	To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .
1424	I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .
2243	Almost peerlessly unsettling .
4500	It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .
3652	The most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from Portugal .
4646	A certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents .
6306	Passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone .
2390	This film is so different from The Apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see Samira Makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success .
1062	Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
4281	Self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable .
2877	Take Care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length .
6613	Trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` What if ? '
338	One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .
7188	The movie is ... very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes .
7	Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .
7094	The film is full of charm .
2492	Schrader examines Crane 's decline with unblinking candor .
1585	An engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary .
3820	Although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , `` Orange County '' is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be .
1294	Because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we 've somehow never seen before .
730	You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
4940	The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .
1951	Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .
7257	Roman Polanski 's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than ` Shindler 's List ' - it is more than merely a Holocaust movie .
2490	The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and Bertrand Tavernier 's oft-brilliant Safe Conduct -LRB- `` Laissez-passer '' -RRB- wears its heart on its sleeve .
938	The whole affair is as predictable as can be .
2370	Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .
305	Buy popcorn .
8489	For all its brilliant touches , Dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .
7736	Kids who are into this Thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven .
7639	The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .
4205	Right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
5250	Though Nijinsky 's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature .
3812	Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .
5691	Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .
1859	If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
3105	With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment

7159	It thankfully goes easy on the reel\/real world dichotomy that -LRB- Jaglom -RRB- pursued with such enervating determination in Venice\/Venice .
2659	Some episodes work , some do n't .
2288	When not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .

5244	... really horrible drek .
636	This is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek -LRB- as well as a serious debt to The Road Warrior -RRB- , but it feels like unrealized potential

1283	An ebullient Tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing .
237	A rip-roaring comedy action fest that 'll put hairs on your chest .
5615	Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
8080	The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .

3741	When the heroes were actually under 40 ?
4756	Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .
4135	Degenerates into hogwash .
703	Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , Scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting .
3138	With few respites , Marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in Moulin Rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it .
4116	The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .
5653	A predictable , manipulative stinker .
220	A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
1118	Anemic , pretentious .
2956	Peter Jackson has done the nearly impossible .
5385	Sparse but oddly compelling .
