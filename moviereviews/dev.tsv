1726	Even if the Naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm .	4
5088	It 's a wonderful , sobering , heart-felt drama .	4
3162	While the transgressive trappings -LRB- especially the frank sex scenes -RRB- ensure that the film is never dull , Rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .	1
8170	Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .	1
3473	-LRB- The digital effects -RRB- reminded me of Terry Gilliam 's rudimentary old Monty Python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together .	2

8504	Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .	1
7777	More concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , Soderbergh 's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem .	4

2072	Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .	1
4450	Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .	3

3989	Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .	1
3518	The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .	1
6771	A burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .	4
1668	Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .	1
3456	Happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and does n't pummel us with phony imagery or music .	4
7725	The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .	0
4286	Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .	1
4651	A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .	1
8510	It never rises to its clever what-if concept .	1
7217	The story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long .	2
3334	The movie 's captivating details are all in the performances , from Foreman 's barking-mad Taylor to Thewlis 's smoothly sinister Freddie and Bettany\/McDowell 's hard-eyed gangster .	4
4264	Writer-director David Jacobson and his star , Jeremy Renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster 's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted .	4

1259	About a Boy vividly recalls the Cary Grant of Room for One More , Houseboat and Father Goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him .	2
3424	Garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work .	3
2921	More than their unique residences , Home Movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it .	4
7355	It is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this .	3
4578	The film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of De Palma , but what makes it transporting is that it 's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an American director in years .	3
5710	The film is flat .	1

2076	Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .	2

5093	Canada 's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the Inuit people .	3
8391	The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .	1
1659	But it 's worth the concentration .	3
2485	Does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .	2

4054	You leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .	1
6933	In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .	3
5121	Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .	1

2972	Tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world 's great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances .	3
4681	High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .	3
5943	This is n't exactly profound cinema , but it 's good-natured and sometimes quite funny .	3
5267	The problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart .	4
3010	It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .	0

8387	Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .	1
2479	Victor Rosa is Leguizamo 's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance .	4
7692	The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -LRB- the characters ' -RRB- misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .	1

763	Fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy .	3
1692	The worst film of the year .	0
4792	What might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .	2
