3565	I found The Ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound .	3
7501	As well-acted and well-intentioned as All or Nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good .	2
7144	The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .	3

6484	See Scratch for the history , see Scratch for the music , see Scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion .	4

5666	Make like the title and dodge this one .	0
1147	The rare Imax movie that you 'll wish was longer than an hour .	3
4093	-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .	1
8037	A flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds .	2
52	Finally coming down off of Miramax 's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , Waking Up in Reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie .	2
8500	Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .	0
5591	Ben Kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of Ghandi gone bad .	4
3715	What started out as a taut contest of wills between Bacon and Theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence .	2
6945	Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .	0
2075	At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .	3
6548	All in all , a great party .	3
5657	Yes , it 's as good as you remember .	3
7701	Although I did n't hate this one , it 's not very good either .	1

1001	None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .	1
7597	A polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con .	3
1016	Well , they 're ` they ' .	2
154	Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .	1
6645	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .	0
1353	A beautifully observed character piece .	4
108	The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .	2
3552	Despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , The Man Who Wrote Rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .	1
1034	Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .	0
8307	It 's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it 's entertaining enough and worth a look .	2
4688	Despite its raucous intent , XXX is as conventional as a Nike ad and as rebellious as spring break .	2
1150	This filmed Tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it 's filmed Tosca that you want .	3
6465	This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .	1
7668	An inventive , absorbing movie that 's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist .	4
7546	It is OK for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged .	3
7409	I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .	0
2331	All of it works smoothly under the direction of Spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely .	4
1286	Chelsea Walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe .	1
2589	The animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst .	4
1711	I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .	1
2430	`` Me Without You '' is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades .	2
5484	High Crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort .	2
3844	the phone rings and a voice tells you you 've got seven days left to live .	2
4029	Like Brosnan 's performance , Evelyn comes from the heart .	4
505	It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .	3
5102	None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .	1
7120	Parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for Ram Dass 's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic .	1
817	If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .	1
2559	Jacquot 's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances ... while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself .	3
7036	An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .	1
5165	Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .	2
1864	Leigh is n't breaking new ground , but he knows how a daily grind can kill love .	3
7482	While the frequent allusions to gurus and doshas will strike some Westerners as verging on mumbo-jumbo ... broad streaks of common sense emerge with unimpeachable clarity .	3
2211	Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .	0
346	Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .	1
1611	Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .	4
663	Brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade .	4
7532	A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .	2
3915	A chiller resolutely without chills .	0
6750	A sexy , surprising romance ... Idemoto and Kim make a gorgeous pair ... their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger .	4
1045	All the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable .	2
2558	A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .	2
7446	Shame on writer\/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .	1
5092	It is not what you see , it is what you think you see .	2
5693	This rich , bittersweet Israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man Pasach ` ke Burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines .	3
3354	A journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes Holly and Marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship .	3
4993	Its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .	1
8506	Like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film .	3
7970	the film does n't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half	1
3414	Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .	1
7048	Vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of Mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all .	4
4369	An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .	0
1506	A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .	0
2347	While some will object to the idea of a Vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , Soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation .	1
7879	I found myself liking the film , though in this case one man 's treasure could prove to be another man 's garbage .	2
3701	It 's a testament to the film 's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries .	3
4765	With We Were Soldiers , Hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the Vietnam War before the pathology set in .	3
4747	A tone poem of transgression .	3
5633	You know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ?	2
2010	underventilated	2
7850	Even if you do n't know the band or the album 's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st Century .	3
3753	it 's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original .	4
829	Chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack .	1
6042	It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .	1
1264	The movie is as padded as Allen 's jelly belly .	1
3026	a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite .	3
5671	The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .	1
3530	The film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome .	2
1708	A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps .	2
7870	Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .	2
3246	-LRB- Screenwriter -RRB- Pimental took the Farrelly Brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .	2
1566	Miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary .	4
8124	The picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it 's no glance .	3
328	Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .	1

6108	This is Christmas Future for a lot of baby boomers .	3
7152	All movie long , City by the Sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of De Niro , McDormand and the other good actors in the cast .	1

738	Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .	1
2276	Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made Vittorio De Sica proud .	3
4103	Seen in that light , Moonlight Mile should strike a nerve in many .	3
5878	It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .	1
4015	Evelyn 's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn .	3
2303	Starts slowly , but Adrien Brody -- in the title role -- helps make the film 's conclusion powerful and satisfying .	3
155	... stale and uninspired .	1
1590	The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .	2

382	Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .	0
5462	Adaptation is simply brilliant .	4
25	The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .	2
6002	Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .	1
534	It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .	2

5196	`` It 's all about the image . ''	2
5777	Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .	3
4810	Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .	1

6564	The best animated feature to hit theaters since Beauty and the Beast 11 years ago .	4
3814	What lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map .	3
7863	The movie is a mess from start to finish .	1
2059	Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie .	1
1860	`` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .	2
7178	Coral Reef Adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world 's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching .	3
8444	Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .	0
1020	For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .	3
8461	-LRB- Taylor -RRB- takes us on a ride that 's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .	2
5819	Grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length	1

1549	The actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script 's bad ideas and awkwardness .	3
481	This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .	1
2300	The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .	2
5613	Everyone 's insecure in Lovely and Amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships .	4
3083	On that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint .	4
5035	When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails .	1
1569	Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .	0
2717	Fontaine 's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .	4
3641	About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .	1
1314	Cold and scattered , Minority Report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals .	2

3938	-LRB- Swimfan -RRB- falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .	0
1703	The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .	1
5106	A little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged .	3

3351	I know we 're not supposed to take it seriously , but I ca n't shake the thought that Undercover Brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary .	2
7146	Ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and Joan 's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he 's a disloyal satyr .	2
3895	This is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a Friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn .	3

554	Parts	2
5884	Simply put , `` Far From Heaven '' is a masterpiece .	4
3680	A great companion piece to other Napoleon films .	3
7407	... an interesting slice of history .	3
3890	Hawn and Sarandon form an acting bond that makes The Banger Sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare .	4
5171	It 's always enthralling .	4
4615	It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .	1
2381	A different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of World War II through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst .	3
7851	An off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world .	3
3534	Helps to remind the First World that HIV\/AIDS is far from being yesterday 's news .	2
6192	Though Jackson does n't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees .	3
5318	The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .	1
4567	Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .	3
3304	Oh , and more entertaining , too .	3
2713	Compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get .	3
1557	A funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage `` be careful what you wish for '' is given a full workout .	4
7071	When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .	1
5281	But seriously , folks , it does n't work .	1
4180	The level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we 've long associated with Washington the actor .	3
422	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke	1
3605	Birthday Girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked .	4
919	Davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as Amy .	3
7491	The byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , Carmen -LRB- Vega -RRB- and Juni -LRB- Sabara -RRB- Cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take .	4
6565	A farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it is n't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .	2
4722	` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit	3
2605	Adam Sandler 's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you -- like a rash .	0

1816	Tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here .	3
5039	The film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness .	3
1209	A moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine .	4
1885	-LRB- The kid 's -RRB- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .	1
2070	I 've never bought from telemarketers , but I bought this movie .	3
3765	It 's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate .	4
405	`` Barbershop '' is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story .	3
2215	What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .	1
7321	The all-French cast is marveilleux .	4
252	The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .	0
6997	Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .	3
6112	Should have gone straight to video .	0
4794	Ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of Chinese ` cultural revolution . '	3
309	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .	3
2970	A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .	1
7633	It 's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and I think that 's what I liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline .	3

2435	The film has a childlike quality about it .	2
8415	The whole mildly pleasant outing -- the R rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of Tim Allen .	2
7538	One of the year 's best films , featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by Julianne Moore .	4
6644	For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie .	3
3	Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .	1

3322	They were right .	2
5674	SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .	1
4147	Scott Baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects .	3
2035	Bring on the sequel .	3
6886	-LRB- MacDowell -RRB- ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .	0
3020	If I want music , I 'll buy the soundtrack .	1

4631	Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .	1
7694	At its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist 's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood .	2
5978	But the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .	1
5399	Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .	1
588	Show me the mugging .	2

869	Kaufman and Jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .	2
5783	This is just lazy writing .	0
7921	, `` They 're out there ! ''	3
2583	Every child 's story is what matters .	2
4805	The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .	1
1188	The large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible IMAX sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes .	4
2194	Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .	1
537	Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .	1
3713	B picture , and I mean that as a compliment .	2
5930	The camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm .	4
3984	Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .	1
951	With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .	1
805	White has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .	1
7999	One of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect .	3
6793	Khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum .	3
7557	That , in itself , is extraordinary .	4
1159	As a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , Sex with Strangers is a success .	3
4278	-LRB- Rises -RRB- above its oh-so-Hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism .	3
2604	Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .	1
5672	There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .	2
6210	As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .	1
1632	Some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the Ball and Chain .	2
5968	Alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise .	3

2396	Lookin ' for sin , American-style ?	1
6269	It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .	1
1671	A fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion .	3
5818	Many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and I do n't think that A.C. will help this movie one bit .	0
8149	At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .	1
4784	lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .	1
1770	A fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , Blair Witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .	2
7836	An unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage .	3
2542	The charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film 's problems .	3
3277	Like Mike is a slight and uninventive movie : Like the exalted Michael Jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .	1
5009	Implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most American of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest Hollywood document of all .	3
7915	Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .	0
5094	Several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` Unfaithful . ''	0
229	Jolting into Charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent -LRB- accurate ?	2
5515	The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .	0
2232	A creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man ... about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy .	3
1214	If you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , Sweet Home Alabama is diverting in the manner of Jeff Foxworthy 's stand-up act .	2
4827	A huge box-office hit in Korea , Shiri is a must for genre fans .	3
3018	Lovingly photographed in the manner of a Golden Book sprung to life , Stuart Little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness .	4
6659	The cast is top-notch and I predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over Michael Idemoto as Michael .	4
5069	A lack of thesis makes Maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .	2
3799	Grating and tedious .	1
2295	Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?	0
1979	The touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible .	3
2903	The Pinochet Case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most .	2
102	A surprisingly ` solid ' achievement by director Malcolm D. Lee and writer John Ridley .	3
2413	Seeing Seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on Letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but .	2
4344	Straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , Possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it .	3

1984	Laughably , irredeemably awful .	0

7663	In the wake of Saving Private Ryan , Black Hawk Down and We Were Soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as Cage 's war-weary marine .	1
6744	I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .	1
4503	Yo , it 's The Days Of Our Lives meets Electric Boogaloo .	2
5352	It is definitely worth seeing .	4
3614	Not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been ?	1
7820	The film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality .	3
6173	Who knows , but it works under the direction of Kevin Reynolds .	3
4124	In capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st .	2
6345	Scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar .	4
2791	A graceful , moving tribute to the courage of New York 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice .	4
4193	-LRB- Breheny 's -RRB- lensing of the New Zealand and Cook Island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people .	4
3532	Has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy ca n't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original .	2
4863	This is n't a new idea .	1
808	It may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer .	3
2125	would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed ` The French Lieutenant 's Woman . '	3
7350	Often overwrought and at times positively irritating , the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself .	2
2452	Director Douglas McGrath takes on Nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading .	0
5730	A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .	0
3727	It 's the perfect star vehicle for Grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona .	3
1856	Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .	0
4441	Hardly a film that comes along every day .	3
8245	While general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of Cuban music , they 'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds .	4
592	If you 're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director 's life , Eisenstein delivers .	3
4360	Originality is sorely lacking .	1
5894	`` The Tuxedo '' should have been the vehicle for Chan that `` The Mask '' was for Jim Carrey .	2
6910	Viewers of Barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .	1
8511	Much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words do n't really do the era justice .	3
2842	In The New Guy , even the bull gets recycled .	1
3810	The characters never change .	1
8195	There are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them .	2
1442	In my opinion , Analyze That is not as funny or entertaining as Analyze This , but it is a respectable sequel .	2

1186	-LRB- Kirshner wins , but it 's close . -RRB-	2
5282	Too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper -LRB- and better -RRB- than Pink Floyd tickets .	3
8408	An interesting look behind the scenes of Chicago-based rock group Wilco ...	3
7016	Judging by those standards , ` Scratch ' is a pretty decent little documentary .	3
7534	A thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation .	3
2394	The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut .	1

8463	Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .	1
3879	Solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining .	1
523	Highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it .	3

1517	Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King .	1
6380	By the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest can not be revived .	1
7130	Watching the chemistry between Freeman and Judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing .	3
5209	Despite its shortcomings , Girls Ca n't Swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it 's a worthy entry in the French coming-of-age genre .	3
55	Perhaps it 's cliche to call the film ` refreshing , ' but it is .	4
3061	Incoherence reigns .	1
1429	I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .	0

4851	All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .	1
3405	Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version -LRB- no more racist portraits of Indians , for instance -RRB- , but the excitement is missing .	1
5975	Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?	1
280	In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .	0
7308	That rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults .	4
1678	It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .	4
5908	... even if you 've never heard of Chaplin , you 'll still be glued to the screen .	4
3841	When you 've got the wildly popular Vin Diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed .	3
2259	Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .	0
